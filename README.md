# spinning-cube-render

This my spinning cube render attempt made in C++ with SFML.

To build this project:
1. Create a new directory (or do it in the main folder, up to you I guess), I called mine /build/
2. In this folder, run "cmake .." in your terminal, then run "make"
3. Run the application that should now be created by typing in the terminal "./spinning-cube-render"
